    <h style="font-size: 30px;">What is New Jersey Weed Wizard?</h><br>
    NJWW is an independently ran cannabis review site ran by Chris Brooks, the Weed Wizard.<br>
    The goal of this site is to provide accurate information about products, dispensaries, and brands.<br><br>


    On February 21st, 2021, New Jersey legalized cannabis for adult (or "recreational") use, allowing<br>
    anyone 21 or older with a valid ID to purchase products from a registered dispensary.<br><br>

    As the cannabis industry continues to grow in New Jersey,
    NJWW aims to stay persistent in expanding a reliable database. <br>
    <br>
    
    <h style="font-size: 30px;">Who am I?</h><br>
    My name is Chris. I am a New Jersey native who has spent ~95% of my life living here,<br>
    and the other remaining 5% traveling and living in Las Vegas for a year and a half.<br>
   
    I've been a resident of Gloucester County for most of that time, with some jobs<br> during the summer,
    where I would live down in Wildwood for the season. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Cannabis has been a part of my life for over 10 years now, I believe that when used responsibly,<br>
    marijuana and similar products such as concentrates and edibles, can have amazing benefits.<br>
